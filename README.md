# Selection-Sort
- the sort algorithm is process by finding the smallest array( ascending order) 
- from unsorted part and put them at the begining of main array
- so it have two subArray, one sorted and one remaining part unsorted.
- iterate main array , the minimum elemnet from unsorted subarray and move to the sorted subarray
